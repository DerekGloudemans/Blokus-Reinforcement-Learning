# Blokus-Reinforcement-Learning

This project aims to create an efficient implementation of the gme Blokus for eventual use as a reinforcement learning task. So far, the logic of the game has been implemented. Next, we will experiment with basic heuristic search, then adversarial heuristic search. An interface will be added by which a human can interact with the game. Finally, a reinforcement learning agent will be trained to play the game. 

The structure of the Player class and the methods by which agents interact with the game will likely undergo changes as the project progresses.

For more information, read the comment blocks before each Class.
